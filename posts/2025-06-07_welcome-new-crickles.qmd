As you can see, the Crickles website has had a makeover. The first purpose of this is to re-integrate the Navigator with the rest of our content; these have been separated for some months and are now back together.

A second purpose is to provide a site where methodology descriptions, occasional news and the Navigator can be seen together. Methodology descriptions and underlying research are grouped under the **Research** heading on the menu bar. At the time of writing, there are two papers there:

1.  A detailed explanation of how Crickles calculates sustainable heart rate.
2.  Our analysis of the relationship between the frequency or *irregular* activities and a diagnosis of a heart rhythm issue such as atrial fibrillation.

It is our intention to build out much more such content. To guide us, we are still keen to get feedback on how comprehensible, interesting and possibly even useful this is. The derivation of sustainable heart rate is relatively straightforward in comparison to the models used to determine heart rate intensity and cardiac stress. We want to ensure that the exposition of the material matches the nature of interest from the Crickles community and we can expect to have to learn how we go to get this right.

Meanwhile, for the time being other content remains on the old home page, which you can still find [here](https://crickles.casa).
