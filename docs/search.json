The red lozenges show the values for our sample athlete whose data we’ll be looking at later.\nThe median values across all athletes can be summarised as follows:\n\n\n   max_6   max_20   max_40   max_60  ratio_6 ratio_20 ratio_40 \n 175.906  170.557  166.559  161.808    0.919    0.951    0.979 \n\n\nHere the max_ values show the median maximum heart rate for the period in minutes shown. For example, max_20 gives the median heart rate that can be sustained for 20 minutes by this sample of athletes on Crickles. The ratio_ values, which are ultimately more important in Crickles, are the median values of the ratio between the sustainable rate over one hour and the corresponding period, respectively. For example, ratio_20 is the median value of the 60 minutes sustainable heart rate over the 20 minute sustainable heart rate; ratio_60 isn’t shown because by definition it would always be 1. These ratios enable us to infer what levels sustained over different durations might imply for the capacity to sustain a heart rate for an hour.\nWe’re going to use ratio_n values to calculate sustainable heart rate so it matters that they’re stable and reasonably consistent between athletes. Experience shows that they don’t change much over time. We can get a measure of their stability across athletes by looking at the interquartile range, or spread of the majority of the values, as a proportion of the median:\n\n\nCode\nall_athletes |&gt; \n  select(-athlete_id) |&gt; \n  map_dbl(\\(x) (100 * IQR(x)/median(x)) |&gt; round(1))\n\n\n   max_6   max_20   max_40   max_60  ratio_6 ratio_20 ratio_40 \n     7.4      9.6      9.1      9.0      3.8      3.5      2.0 \n\n\nThis shows that there is much less dispersion of the ratios than there is of the maximum values, and it’s the ratios that we need to be consistent across time and athletes. Taking ratio_20 as an example again, this shows that half of the athletes have values lying in a band around the median whose width is 3.5% of the median value (so most would be within 2% of the median).\nWe might wonder whether the ratios change as athletes age. We know that maximum heart rates does, and we can verify that here. For example, we can show the tendency for the heart rate that can be sustained for 20 minutes to decline with age:\n\n\nCode\nall_athletes &lt;- all_athletes |&gt; \n  left_join(athlete_age) \n\n\nJoining with `by = join_by(athlete_id)`\n\n\nCode\nall_athletes |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = max_20)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = F) +\n    theme_light() +\n    labs(title = \"Sustainable 20 minute heart rate as a function of age\",\n          y = \"bpm\",\n          caption = paste(\"Source: Crickles. n: \", nrow(all_athletes)))\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no such relationship between the ratios and age. To get a better sense of the relationship between all of these variables and age we can look at a correlation matrix:\n\n\nCode\nall_athletes |&gt; \n  select(-athlete_id) |&gt; \n  cor() |&gt; \n  as.table() |&gt; \n  as.data.frame() |&gt; \n  setNames(c(\"Var1\", \"Var2\", \"Correlation\")) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(Var1, Var2, fill = Correlation)) +\n  geom_tile(color = \"white\") + \n  geom_text(aes(label = scales::label_number(accuracy = 0.01)(Correlation),\n                color = abs(Correlation) &lt; 0.5), \n                size = 3.5) + \n  scale_fill_gradient2(low = \"blue\", \n                       mid = \"white\", \n                       high = \"red\", \n                       midpoint = 0) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"black\", \"white\"), \n                     guide = \"none\") + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Correlation Matrix\", \n       fill = \"Correlation\", \n       x = \"\", \n       y = \"\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is evident that age correlates strongly (and negatively) with maximum heart rate levels - about 60% in all windows - but only inconsequentially with the ratios."

    "text": "4 Application to individual athletes\nThe calculation of Sustainable Heart Rate is in two steps:\n\nFor each activity where heart rate is recorded the observed maximum heart rate over each of the time windows cited above is calculated. Each of these is weighted, also as above, to convert it to an estimate of a one hour equivalent. The maximum of these is recorded as the spot_hr for that activity. The purpose of this is to use information from a number of different time windows as it is only relatively rarely that an athlete will operate at or over threshold for an hour or more.\nAt any point in time Crickles looks back to find the maximum recent spot_hr value. Recency is important as fitness, including cardiac fitness, varies seasonally and with age and a performance observed, say, a year ago may not be repeatable today. Conversely, it is necessary to look back far enough to capture any efforts that are still indicative of current fitness. The Sustainable Heart Rate calculation aims to attain a balance that captures relevantly recent activities while discarding observations as they become stale.\n\n\n4.1 Determining spot_hr\n\n\nCode\n# We create a function that calculates the maximum sustained hr over each window\n# and then converts these to an hour equivalent using the weights found above.\n\n# First, we make a function that does this given 'streams'...\nhr_windows_weighted &lt;- function(streams) {  \n  \n  # Define HR weights explicitly\n  weights &lt;- c(HR_6 = 0.913, HR_20 = 0.954, HR_40 = 0.98, HR_60 = 1)\n\n  # Safely compute sustainable HR values\n  sus_windows &lt;- possibly(hr_windows, \n                          otherwise = setNames(rep(NA_real_, length(weights)), names(weights)))(streams)\n\n  sus_windows &lt;- unlist(sus_windows)[names(weights)] \n\n  # Calculate weighted HR\n  weighted_hr &lt;- sus_windows * weights\n\n  # Find max weighted HR, handling NA\n  spot_hr &lt;- suppressWarnings(max(weighted_hr, na.rm = TRUE))\n  if (!is.finite(spot_hr)) spot_hr &lt;- NA_real_\n\n  # Find corresponding window length and extract numeric part\n  spot_window &lt;- if (!is.na(spot_hr)) {\n    names(weighted_hr)[which.max(weighted_hr)] |&gt; \n      str_remove(\"HR_\") |&gt; \n      as.numeric()\n  } else {\n    NA_real_\n  }\n\n  # Return formatted list\n  list(\n    spot_hr = round(spot_hr, 1),\n    best_window = spot_window,\n    all_weighted_hr = round(weighted_hr, 1)\n  )\n}\n\n# Then we wrap this in a function that takes an activity id...\nactivity_windows_weighted &lt;- function(act_ID) {\n  safe_fetch_streams &lt;- possibly(fetch_streams, \n                                 otherwise = NULL)\n  safe_hr_windows_weighted &lt;- possibly(hr_windows_weighted, \n                                       otherwise = list(spot_hr = NA))\n  this_streams &lt;- safe_fetch_streams(params$athlete, act_ID)\n  \n  if (is.null(this_streams)) return(NA)\n  results &lt;- safe_hr_windows_weighted(this_streams)\n  return(results$spot_hr)\n}\n\n\nAs an example, take an activity that has this heart rate chart:\n\n\nCode\nsample &lt;- fetch_streams(params$athlete, params$sample_id) \nsample |&gt;\n  mutate(minutes = time/60) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = minutes, y = heartrate)) +\n  geom_point(col = \"red\") +\n  geom_line(col = \"red3\") +\n  theme_light()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can find the sustained heart rate over each of the time windows:\n\n\nCode\nhr_windows(sample) |&gt; unlist() |&gt; round(1)\n\n\n HR_6 HR_20 HR_40 HR_60 \n131.2 125.2 122.2 118.2 \n\n\nFor example, the value labelled HR_20 is the highest heart rate that was sustained for 20 minutes.\nUsing this information together with the equivalency weights, we calculate the spot_hr and show the time window on which this is based:\n\n\nCode\nhr_windows_weighted(sample)\n\n\n$spot_hr\n[1] 119.8\n\n$best_window\n[1] 6\n\n$all_weighted_hr\n HR_6 HR_20 HR_40 HR_60 \n119.8 119.5 119.7 118.2 \n\n\nIn this example, the short effort spike that can be seen on the chart almost half way through the activity gives us the highest estimate for the one hour sustainable heart rate so we use that.\nThe spot_hr, being the estimated sustained heart rate for each individual activity, is shown in Crickles on the Activities page as is the corresponding time window, which appears as Best_HR_Bucket.\n\n\n4.2 Sustainable Heart Rate\nFrom the history of spot_hr’s for each activity with heart rate data we need to compute a sustainable heart rate estimate for each point in time. For this, we must observe and remember the greatest recent effort, remembering that it is relatively rare for an athlete to push themselves to the limit. The way that Crickles currently composes a sustainable heart rate estimate from the history of spot_hr’s is to average the highest value from the last four weeks and the highest value from the last twelve weeks (which may be the same). The rationale for this is as follows… As fitness varies, we take the last four week period to be definitive for current fitness. On the other hand, observations taken from over twelve weeks (almost a quarter) into the past are taken to be stale from the perspective of current capability. Observations of spot_hr from between four and the twelve weeks ago can still colour the current estimate but cannot wholly define it.\nWe can illustrate this with an example.\n\n\nCode\n# sample_athlete is a dataframe of activities for one sample athlete\n# here we calculate the spot_hr for each one\nplan(multisession, workers = 8)\nsample_athlete$spot_hr &lt;- future_map_dbl(sample_athlete$ID, activity_windows_weighted) \nplan(sequential)\n\n# a bit of renaming...\nsample_athlete &lt;- sample_athlete |&gt; \n  rename(start_date_local = Date,\n         id = ID)\n\n# now we define a function to roll up sustainable hr as described\nsus_hr &lt;- function(acts) {\nacts |&gt;\n  arrange(start_date_local) |&gt;\n  mutate(date1 = ymd(as.Date(start_date_local)),\n         spot_hr_valid = ifelse(Regular == \"Regular\", spot_hr, NA)) |&gt;\n  complete(date1 = full_seq(date1, period = 1)) |&gt;\n  fill(spot_hr, spot_hr_valid) |&gt;\n  mutate(sus_hr_short = rollmax(spot_hr_valid,\n                                28,\n                                align = \"right\",\n                                na.rm = TRUE,\n                                fill = NA),\n          sus_hr_long = rollmax(spot_hr_valid,\n                                84,\n                                align = \"right\",\n                                na.rm = TRUE,\n                                fill = NA),\n          sustainable_hr = round(0.5*(sus_hr_short + sus_hr_long),1)) |&gt;\n  select(-c(date1, sus_hr_short, sus_hr_long, spot_hr_valid)) |&gt;\n  drop_na(id) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(start_date_local)) -&gt; acts\nreturn(acts)\n}\n\n# and see how that applies to our sample athlete:\nsus_hr(sample_athlete) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = start_date_local)) +\n  geom_point(aes(y = spot_hr), col = \"grey\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = sustainable_hr), col = \"seagreen\") +\n  theme_light() +\n  labs(title = \"Sustainable heart rate (line) over spot_hr (points)\", \n       x = \"date\",\n       y = \"heart rate (bpm)\")\n\n\nWarning: Removed 39 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_line()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that, while there are many different methods we could use to calculate sustainable heart rate including some that give a less stepped line, the method that we use does a good job of sitting just above the spot_hr values. Those points that lie on the green line are precisely those for activities whose heart rate intensity, shown as HRI on the Activities page, is &gt;= 1. On the Crickles Navigator Timeline page this is shown as Intensity in the tool tip for each point with heart rate data, where it is multiplied by 100 (so, for example, 90 instead of 0.9)."
